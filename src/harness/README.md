# Notes on the Harness Code

The code here is heavily adapted from the repository
[Energy-Languages](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages), which
is the code behind the work detailed
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages) from the
paper "Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages: How does Energy, Time
and Memory Relate?" If this sort of research interests you, I strongly
recommend visiting their site and reading the paper (link available on the
site).

This harness is based specifically on the C code in the
[RAPL](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages/tree/master/RAPL)
sub-directory.
