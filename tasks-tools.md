# Tasks and Tools Tracking

Here, I am keeping track of the tasks I've identified and the tools that I'm
using thus far. This is a precursor to shifting all or most of this to Dendron.

## Tasks

1. Gather references
2. Select example problem/exercise to implement
   1. C implementation
   2. Rust implementation
3. Gather comparative metrics
4. Write

## Tools

Tools I am currently using or expect to make use of:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - general editing
  * [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) - personal knowledge management (PKM)
  * Language modes for C and Rust
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Rust language home page
* [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) - installer/manager for Rust
* [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) - memory profiling/dynamic analysis tool
* [TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) TeX/LaTeX GUI editor
